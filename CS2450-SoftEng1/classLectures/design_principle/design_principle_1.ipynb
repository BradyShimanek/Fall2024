    "### Why Design Principles Matter in Software Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Software design principles are guidelines that help developers create software that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Scalability**: Well-designed software can be easily extended to handle growth (e.g., more users, more features) without major rework.\n",
    "  - **Maintainability**: Code following design principles is easier to fix, modify, and enhance.\n",
    "  - **Reusability**: Encourages the creation of components or modules that can be reused in different parts of the application or even in different projects.\n",
    "  - **Collaboration**: Clear and structured code facilitates better teamwork, making it easier for multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts."

    "### Consequences of Poor Design\n",
    "- **High Maintenance Costs**: When software is poorly designed, small changes can require significant effort. This leads to high maintenance costs over time.\n",
    "  - **Example**: Adding a new feature might require modifying multiple parts of the codebase due to tight coupling and lack of modularity.\n",
    "- **Low Scalability**: Poorly designed software often cannot handle increasing loads or complexity without a complete overhaul.\n",
    "  - **Example**: A monolithic application with no clear separation of concerns struggles to scale horizontally (e.g., by distributing workloads across multiple servers).\n",
    "- **Technical Debt**: Shortcuts in design can lead to \"technical debt,\" which accumulates over time, making future development slower and more expensive.\n",
    "  - **Example**: Over time, a lack of proper design can result in a \"big ball of mud\" architecture—where the system becomes tangled and difficult to manage or refactor."
