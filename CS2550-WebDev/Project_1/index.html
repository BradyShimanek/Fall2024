I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs):  I really enjoyed writing this program, but had trouble with getting the 
weekly schedule to look similar to the one in the assignment description. Other than that, writing HTML
is a lot of fun! I have a very small amount of experience writing some HTML so it wasn't too tough so 
I am excited to learn more!

                    <h2 class="haiku-title">Focus: A Haiku About My Study Music</h2>
                    <!-- <p class="poem">This haiku was inspired by the current song I was listening to when I wrote it. If you've seen Kung Fu Panda, you'll know the song.</p> -->
                    <p class="poem"><i>Ode to my master</i></p>
                    <p class="poem"><i>He transcends beyond this life</i></p>
                    <p class="poem"><i>Oogway ascended</i></p>
                </div>

                <h2 class="personal-interests">My Personal Interests</h2>
                <p>I like playing music. Don't get it twisted--just because I like playing it, doesn't mean that I am <i>good</i> at playing it. I mainly just like the way 
                    it sounds when I learn a few chords and make up some songs on my own. My main instruments are the piano, guitar, and electric guitar.</p>
                <p>I also like sports. My favorite sports are Basketball and Football. My favorite NBA team is the Utah Jazz of course. My favorite NFL team is the Dolphins.
                    I used to live there for a couple years, and I never really paid attention to the NFL until I decided one day that it was fun to have a team that I can 
                    be connected to. My favorite college football teams are the U of U and BYU. Always been a BYU fan, but continually disappointed in them haha!
                </p>
                <p>Another thing about me is that I like fishing. Mainly in the ocean, but seeing that I live in the great landlocked state of Utah, fishing in the ocean is
                    pretty few and far between. I don't mind fishing in the lakes around here, but I personally don't have a boat or anything to get me out in the middle of
                    the body of water to get the best fish. The great thing about ocean fishing is you can fish from a pier, or really anywhere and catch some of the coolest
                    fish ever. And yes, I have caught a couple sharks.
                </p>
